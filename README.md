# ðŸ”¥ AOA-FinalProject- ðŸ”¥

## Overview :writing_hand:

---

Our final project will choose the cheapest path to travel from one destination to another. The program will plan a navigational route for the user. Under the hood the program will implement two algorithms (A\* Search & Djikstra's Algorithm) to calculate the best path in the fastest and most efficient time. To compare the two algorithms we will time them and measure their execution time to see which one performs faster.

### Djikstra Algorithm :dash:

    Djikstra is an algorithm for finding the shortest path between vertices in a graph. Djikstra tracks the cost of every vertex from the root vertex and chooses the path with the least cost and unvisited vertices. Djikstra is implemented using a min-priority queue or can be also be implemented with an array given the right conditionals.

### A\* Search Algorithm :brain:

    A* Search is an algorithm that is used widely for path searching and graph traversing. A* is termed an "informed" search because it uses hueristics to have a sense of knowledge knowing it is going in the right direction. Hueristics can be calculated using the Euclydian distance from the vertex to the desired destination.
